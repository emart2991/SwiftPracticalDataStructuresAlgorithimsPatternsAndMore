# SwiftPracticalDataStructuresAlgorithimsPatternsAndMore

This project will contain multiple smaller indepent app projects. The purpose is to act a both a targeted project for mastering and learning different concepts from data structures and algorithims to design patterns in Swift. This was in part inspired by a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTARSJSNGPI) made by [Jonathan Rasmusson](https://github.com/jrasmusson) and check out the repo [here](https://github.com/jrasmusson/ios-starter-kit)
